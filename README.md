# COMSE6998 Advanced Data Structures

Welcome to COMSE6998 Advanced Data Structures!  There will be ~12 lectures, 1 per week. 
The course will cover data structures for 4 main data types: Integers, Geometric data, Strings 
and Graphs. We will split the time between upper and lower bounds in various models of memory.  

## Syllabus:
1. Introduction (Motivation, DS models, static/dynamic, performance guarantees). 
2. Advanced binary search trees (BST model of computation, instance optimality, Splay Trees). 
3. Dynamic optimality conjecture (geometric view, Arboral sets, Wilber's LB, Tango Trees). 
4. Predecessor search UBs on the RAM: van-Emde Boas Trees and Fusion Trees. 
5. Predecessor search LB via Round-Elimination (asymmetric communication complexity view). 
6. Near-Neighbor Search (locality-sensitive hashing, LBs via lopsided set disjointness, Cell-Sampling). 
7. Orthogonal Range Counting (Range Trees, Fractional Cascading, Dynamization via BB[a] Trees). 
8. Tight LBs for dynamic Range Counting in 1D and 2D (Chronogram method + dynamic Cell Sampling). 
9. Dictionaries and Hashing (Perfect Hashing, Cuckoo Hashing, dynamic dictionaries). 
10. Succinct DS for Information Retrieval (Suffix arrays, compressed pattern matching, Rank UB/LB). 
11. Dynamic undirected connectivity (Link-Cut Trees, Euler Trees, Distance Oracles). 
12. Tight LB for undirected connectivity (Information-Transfer method). The "Multiphase" Conjecture.

## Logistics:  
There will be bi-weekly homeworks (~5-6 in total). Grading will be based on HW (35%), scribing 
1 lecture (15%) and a final project (50%), which will entail exploring and extending a research 
paper of your choice (to be discussed and approved by the instructor and the TAs).
