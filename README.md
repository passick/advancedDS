# COMSE6998 
# Advanced Data Structures

Welcome to COMSE6998 Advanced Data Structures!  

Time: Thursdays, 10:00-12:00. 
Location: 963 Schermerhorn Hall Extension. 

The course will cover data structures in 4 main themes: Integers, Geometry, Graphs and Strings 
(information retrieval). We will spend time on both upper and lower bounds in various memory models.

## Final projects
[Here](./advancedDS_projects_suggestions.pdf) is the list of suggested final projects.

Final projects are due on **Friday, May 10th**.

## Syllabus
1. Introduction (Motivation, DS and memory models, static/dynamic, performance guarantees). 
2. Advanced binary search trees (BST model of computation, instance optimality, Splay Trees). 
3. Dynamic optimality conjecture (geometric view, Arboral sets, Wilber's LB, Tango Trees). 
4. Predecessor search UBs on the RAM: van-Emde Boas Trees and Fusion Trees (stratified trees, Indirection). 
5. Predecessor search LB via Round-Elimination (asymmetric communication complexity paradigm). 
6. Near-Neighbor Search (locality-sensitive hashing, Dynamization via Segment Trees, LBs from 
lopsided set disjointness and metric embeddings, Cell-Sampling). 
7. Orthogonal Range Counting (Layered Range Trees, Fractional Cascading, Dynamization via BB[a] Trees, 
delaying updates via Buffer Trees). 
8. Tight LBs for dynamic Range Counting in 1D and 2D (Chronogram method, dynamic Cell Sampling). 
9. Dictionaries and Hashing (Perfect Hashing, Cuckoo Hashing, dynamic dictionaries). 
10. Succinct DS for Information Retrieval (Suffix arrays, compressed pattern matching, Rank UB/LB). 
11. Dynamic undirected connectivity (Link-Cut Trees, Euler-Tour Trees, Distance Oracles). 
12. Tight LB for undirected connectivity (Information-Transfer method). The "Multiphase" Conjecture.

## Logistics
There will be bi-weekly homeworks (~5-6 in total). Grading will be based on HW (35%), scribing 
1 lecture (15%) and a final project (50%), which will entail exploring and extending a research 
paper of your choice (to be discussed and approved by the instructor and the TAs). 

TA: Gleb Posobin (Room : 522 CSB. Office Hours: Tuesday 4−6pm) 

Instructor: Omri Weinstein (523 CSB. Office Hours: By appointment).
